summary: 
abstract: 'Quantum computing is no longer a distant dream, its rapid progress is poised to revolutionize various fields from drug discovery to optimization. But this leap forward comes with a critical caveat: the pre-quantum cryptographic algorithms that secure our digital infrastructure today such as RSA and ECC are at risk of being broken. With the rise of quantum capabilities, everything from encryption keys to biometric data could become vulnerable to adversaries. The race is on to transition to quantum-safe cryptography before quantum computers reach a critical threshold. At the heart of this global effort lies Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC), the new generation of cryptographic algorithms believed to be both quantum and classically secure. Organizations like NIST are leading international efforts to standardize these algorithms. This talk explores the challenges and innovations in transitioning to PQC, with a special focus on the role of hardware implementation and evaluation in ensuring both performance and security. It will take a deep dive into the Hamming Quasi-Cyclic (HQC) algorithm, one of the candidates selected for standardization by NIST in 2025, and examine how HQC performs under practical constraints and potential side-channel threats.'

title: Design of Quantum Computer Antivirus

summary: 
abstract: 'The development of quantum computers has been advancing rapidly in recent years. In addition to researchers and companies building bigger and bigger machines, these computers are already being actively connected to the internet and offered as cloud-based quantum computer services. As quantum computers become more widely accessible, potentially malicious users could try to execute their code on the machines to leak information from other users, to interfere with or manipulate results of other users, or to reverse engineer the underlying quantum computer architecture and its intellectual property, for example. To analyze such new security threats to cloud-based quantum computers, this work first proposes and explores different types of quantum computer viruses. This work shows that quantum viruses can impact outcomes of Groverâ€™s search algorithm or machine learning classification algorithms running on quantum computers, for example. The work then proposes a first of its kind quantum computer antivirus as a new means of protecting the expensive and fragile quantum computer hardware from quantum computer viruses. The antivirus can analyze quantum computer programs, also called circuits, and detect possibly malicious ones before they execute on quantum computer hardware. As a compile-time technique, it does not introduce any new overhead at run-time of the quantum computer.
