Hi, I’m Sanjay Deshpande — a researcher working at the intersection of cryptography, hardware security, and quantum computing.
{style="text-align: justify;"}

I am a postdoctoral scholar at Northwestern University. My current research is focussed on exploring efficient hardware architectures for post-quantum cryptographic (PQC) algorithms and fully homomorphic encryption schemes, evaluating their side-channel resistance, and contributing to PQC standardization efforts. I recently completed my Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering at Yale University, where I focused on secure and efficient hardware implementations of PQC algorithms.  
{style="text-align: justify;"}

Beyond cryptographic hardware design, I’m also interested in quantum computer security — studying how emerging quantum systems can be attacked and how to defend them at the hardware and architectural levels.
{style="text-align: justify;"}

This site shares my research, publications, and open-source projects. Thanks for stopping by — feel free to reach out if you're working in this space or just curious!

I'm a PhD graduate in [Computer Science](https://cpsc.yale.edu) from Yale, advised by [Ruzica Piskac](http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/piskac/) and [Jakub Szefer](https://caslab.csl.yale.edu/~jakub/). 
My current research focuses on training transformers to solve NP-complete problems using reinforcement learning and improving test-time compute strategies for reasoning. My PhD thesis explores learning randomized reductions and program properties ([Bitween](https://bitween.fun)) for security, privacy, and side-channel resilience. 
<!-- Additionally, I am conducting research on discrete program search to automatically solve abstraction and reasoning tasks. -->
<!-- by integrating _machine learning_ with _formal methods_ -->
<!-- My research focuses on learning randomized reductions and program properties ([Bitween](https://bitween.fun)), with applications in hardware security, leakage resilience ML, and quantum circuits. -->

Currently, I am an Applied Scientist at the [Automated Reasoning Group](https://www.amazon.science/research-areas/automated-reasoning) at AWS, where I work on Neuro-Symbolic AI to prevent factual errors caused by LLM hallucinations using mathematically sound Automated Reasoning checks ([Amazon Bedrock Guardrails](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/prevent-factual-errors-from-llm-hallucinations-with-mathematically-sound-automated-reasoning-checks-preview/)).
<!-- Previously, I developed tools for model-based conformance checking of distributed networked systems at AWS. -->
<!-- mentored by [Rupak Majumdar](https://people.mpi-sws.org/~rupak/). I am developing tools for model-based testing, conformance checking, and fuzzing of distributed networked systems. -->
<!-- My work aims to improve the reliability of AWS services by creating advanced tools for model-based testing, conformance checking, and randomized testing of distributed networked systems.  -->
<!-- and [Nafi Diallo](https://linkedin.com/in/ndiallo).  -->
<!-- Working on Neuro-Symbolic AI to capture symbolic knowledge and prevent factual errors from LLM hallucinations with mathematically sound Automated Reasoning checks (see Amazon Bedrock Guardrails -- \href{https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/prevent-factual-errors-from-llm-hallucinations-with-mathematically-sound-automated-reasoning-checks-preview/}{Automated Reasoning checks}). Co-inventor, along with Rémi Delmas, of a \textbf{US~Patent} filed on mitigating LLM hallucinations~(\textit{ICML 2025}~\cite{erata2025compass}). -->

During my PhD, I investigated side-channel vulnerabilities in low-level code ([EuroS&P 2023](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10190541)) and reverse-engineered quantum circuits from power traces ([CHES 2024](https://tches.iacr.org/index.php/TCHES/article/view/11445/10950), [CCS 2023](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3576915.3623118)). I also explored quantum fault injections and malware ([QCE 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05478), [HOST 2023](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10133711)), analyzed non-functional behaviors of intermittent programs ([TECS 2023](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3563216)), developed software countermeasures using randomized reductions ([ICCAD 2024](papers/erata-2024-systematic.pdf)), and surveyed security verification techniques ([JETC 2023](https://doi.org/10.1145/3564785)). 

Before my PhD, I applied formal methods in industry as a research software engineer through my start-up, contributing to several research collaborations ([COMPSAC 2019](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8754104), [FSE 2018](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3236024.3264588), [FSE 2017](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3106237.3122825), [ASE 2017](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8115703/), [SAC 2017](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3019612.3019747)).
