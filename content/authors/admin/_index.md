Hi, I’m Sanjay Deshpande — a researcher working at the intersection of cryptography, hardware security, and quantum computing.

I recently completed my Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering at Yale University, where I focused on secure and efficient hardware implementations of post-quantum cryptographic (PQC) algorithms. Soon I will be joining as a postdoctoral researcher at Northwestern University, where I plan to continue exploring hardware architectures for PQC, evaluating side-channel resistance, and contributing to PQC standardization efforts.

Beyond cryptographic hardware design, I’m also interested in quantum computer security — studying how emerging quantum systems can be attacked and how to defend them at the hardware and architectural levels.

This site shares my research, publications, and open-source projects. Thanks for stopping by — feel free to reach out if you're working in this space or just curious!
