The lab provided a practical introduction to modeling digital systems with VHDL for logic synthesis. It offered an overview of design flow and tools for FPGAs. The course discussed verification of digital systems using testbenches, prototyping boards, and modern testing equipment, and illustrated VHDL-based design methodology through multiple examples from communications, control, DSP, and cryptography. Laboratory experiments established the link between simulation and actual hardware implementation using FPGA boards.
