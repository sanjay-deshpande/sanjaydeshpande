The lab explored the principles of operation and application of electron devices and linear circuits. Topics covered included semiconductor properties, diodes, bipolar and field effect transistors, biasing techniques, amplifier circuits, frequency response analysis, operational amplifiers, and analog circuit design. Students gained hands-on experience implementing and testing these fundamental electronic components and circuits.
