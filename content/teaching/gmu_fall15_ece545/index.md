The course introduced the design of complex digital systems using hardware description languages. It taught design methodologies that partitioned systems into datapaths and controllers. The focus was on synthesizable RTL VHDL code for digital circuit design using dataflow, structural, and behavioral coding styles. Students were introduced to VHDL simulation and verification, along with FPGA synthesis, placement, routing, timing analysis, and performance optimization. The course required a semester-long project devoted to designing a complex digital system implemented on FPGAs.
