This course served as the foundation of the Computer Engineering program within the Electrical Engineering department. Centered on computer architecture, it equiped students with the theoretical knowledge needed to design a basic processor. The curriculum begin with digital data representation, then progressed to enable students to create circuits for specific algorithmic tasks. To achieve this, the course covers Boolean algebra, combinational circuit design and optimization, and sequential logic design using Finite State Machines. These components culminate in an introduction to fundamental processor design principles, integrating all prior concepts.
